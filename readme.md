>Theme used: [wal.vim](https://github.com/dylanaraps/wal.vim) | [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)

# why
- highly customizable
- code completion
- file explorer
- terminal emulator built-in
- full theme set (it's so good with pywal)
- all the necessary functions binded (at least for me but new bindings can be added easily)
